How To Build

 
* Checkout Source Code

	The JSON-taglib code uses {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_%28software%29}Subversion}} as its source control system. 
	You need to have a Subversion client installed to checkout the source code.
	
	Check out the code with the following command:
	
+--------
$ svn checkout https://json-taglib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/json-taglib/trunk json-taglib
+--------
    
    
* Building

** Pre-Requisites

	You need {{{http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/}J2SE 5.0}} and 
	{{{http://maven.apache.org/download.html}Maven 2}} installed to build JSON-taglib.
	
** Building the Code

	cd into the directory you checked the source out into and execute the following command
	
+--------
$ mvn package
+--------	

	This will compile, test and package the taglib. The resulting jar file can now be found in the <<<target>>>
	directory.
	
** Building this site

	To build this project website, cd into the directory you checked the source out into and execute the following command
	
+--------
$ mvn site
+--------	

	This will build the complete site, including all project reports. 
	The resulting site can be viewed by pointing your browser at <<<target/site/index.html>>>
