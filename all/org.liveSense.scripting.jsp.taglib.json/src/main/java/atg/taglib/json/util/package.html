<p>
This package contains a modified version of Douglas Crockford's JSON Java library
as found <a href="http://json.org/java/">at json.org</a>
</p>
<p>
The package has been renamed from
<code>org.json</code> so that our modifications don't cause collisions when the JSON taglib
is used in envirnonments which are already using the Crockford JSON Java library.
